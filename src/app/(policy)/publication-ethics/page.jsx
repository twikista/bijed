                Peer review assists the editor in making editorial decisions and
                through the editorial communications with the author may also
                assist the author in improving the paper. Peer review is an
                essential component of formal scholarly communication, and lies
                at the heart of the scientific method. In addition to the
                specific ethics-related duties described below, reviewers are
                asked generally to treat authors and their work as they would

                A reviewer should be alert to potential ethical issues in the

                including any substantial similarity or overlap between the
                manuscript under consideration and any other published paper of
                which the reviewer has personal knowledge. Any statement that an

            <div className='space-y-3'>
              <p>
                Reviews should be conducted objectively. Reviewers should be
                aware of any personal bias they may have and take this into
                account when reviewing a paper. Personal criticism of the author
                is inappropriate. Referees should express their views clearly
                with supporting arguments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reviewers should consult the Editor before agreeing to review a
                paper where they have potential conflicts of interest resulting
                from competitive, collaborative, or other relationships or
                connections with any of the authors, companies, or institutions
                connected to the papers.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a reviewer suggests that an author includes citations to the
                reviewer’s (or their associates’) work, this must be for genuine
                scientific reasons and not with the intention of increasing the
                reviewer’s citation count or enhancing the visibility of their
                work (or that of their associates).

                discussion of its significance. Underlying data should be

            <div className='space-y-3'>
              <p>
                The authors should ensure that they have written entirely

                words of others, that this has been appropriately cited or

              <p>
                Proper acknowledgment of the work of others must always be
                given. Authors should cite publications that have influenced the
                reported work and that give the work appropriate context within
                the larger scholarly record. Information obtained privately, as
                in conversation, correspondence, or discussion with third
                parties, must not be used or reported without explicit, written
                permission from the source.
              </p>
              <p>
                Plagiarism takes many forms, from ‘passing off’ another’s paper
                as the author’s own paper, to copying or paraphrasing
                substantial parts of another’s paper (without attribution), to
                claiming results from research conducted by others. Plagiarism
                in all its forms constitutes unethical behaviour and is

                An author should not in general publish manuscripts describing
                essentially the same research in more than one journal of
                primary publication. Submitting the same manuscript to more than
                one journal concurrently constitutes unethical behaviour and is
                unacceptable.

                In general, an author should not submit for consideration in
                another journal a paper that has been published previously,
                except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published
                lecture or academic thesis or as an electronic preprint.

                Authors are expected to consider carefully the list and order of

                submission. Only in exceptional circumstances will the Editor

                When an author discovers a significant error or inaccuracy in
                their own published work, it is the author’s obligation to
                promptly notify the journal editor or publisher and cooperate
                with the editor to retract or correct the paper if deemed
                necessary by the editor. If the editor or the publisher learn
                from a third party that a published work contains an error, it
                is the obligation of the author to cooperate with the editor,
                including providing evidence to the editor where requested.
