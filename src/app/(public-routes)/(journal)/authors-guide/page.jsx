          Editorial Process and Peer Review
        </h3>
        <p>
          Manuscripts are pre-evaluated at the first instance at the Editorial
          Office in order to check whether they meet the basic requirements and
          quality standards, including being screened for plagiarism. Only those
          contributions which conform to the theoretical and/or empirical,
          scholarly standard, and show clear evidence of contribution to
          knowledge will be accepted for peer review. Authors must strictly
          follow these instructions for authors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Journal uses a double peer review processing for all manuscripts
          according to the following criteria: significance of contribution,
          originality of material, clarity of presentation, and relevance to the
          focus of the Journal

          Plagiarism
        </h3>
        <p>
          Plagiarism constitutes unethical scientific behavior and is never
          acceptable. Hence, authors must ensure that all resources used in
          their work is clearly cited and acknowledged. All submissions to BIJED
          will be tested for plagiarism at pre-evalation phase of the review
          process and only submissions with maximum plagiarism score of 10&#37;
          will be moved to the next phase for review.

          Correction of Articles
        </h3>
        <p className='flex-1'>
          Errors discovered by the author after submission but before approval
          for publication should be communicated swiftly to the editor of the
          Journal before the end of the review process.
        </p>
        <p>
          When an author discovers a significant error or inaccuracy in their
          own published work, it is the authorâ€™s obligation to promptly notify
          the journal editor or publisher and cooperate with the editor to
          retract or correct the paper if deemed necessary by the editor. If the
          editor or the publisher learn from a third party that a published work
          contains an error, it is the obligation of the author to cooperate
          with the editor, including providing evidence to the editor where
          requested.
