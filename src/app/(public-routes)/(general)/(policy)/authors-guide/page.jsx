          Manuscripts are pre-evaluated at the first instance at the Editorial

          contributions which conform to the theoretical and/or empirical,
          scholarly standard, and show clear evidence of contribution to
          knowledge will be accepted for peer review. Authors must strictly

          will be moved to the next phase for review.

        <Paragraph first={true}>
          Errors discovered by the author after submission but before approval

        <Paragraph>
          When an author discovers a significant error or inaccuracy in their
          own published work, it is the authorâ€™s obligation to promptly notify
          the journal editor or publisher and cooperate with the editor to
          retract or correct the paper if deemed necessary by the editor. If the
          editor or the publisher learn from a third party that a published work
          contains an error, it is the obligation of the author to cooperate
          with the editor, including providing evidence to the editor where
          requested.
