        <Paragraph first={true}>
          All articles submitted to BIJED go through a double-blind peer review
          process by both Internal and External Reviewers. Submitted manuscripts
          initially pass through preliminary review, where they are
          pre-evaluated at the Editorial Office to check whether they meet the
          basic requirements and quality standards, and thus fit for further
          review.
        </Paragraph>
        <p className='flex-1'>
          Manuscripts that pass the preliminary review will be sent to
          independent reviewers who are selected based on their qualifications,
          expertise and experiences on the area of coverage of the paper to be
          reviewed. Each reviewer receive an honorarium for the article
          reviewed.
        </p>
        <p className='flex-1'>
          Depending on the reviewers recommendations, the reviewed article(s)
          may be sent back to the corresponding author to effect corrections.
          Once it is ascertained that the recommendations of the reviewers are
          effected, the article(s) will be sent for final review.
        </p>
        <p className='flex-1'>
          The final review is conducted by members of the Editorial Board,
          headed by the Editor-in-Chief . The final review will resuit in an
          editorial decision which may be the acceptance or rejection of the
          manuscript, or recommendation for further work. The corresponding
          author will be notified of the Editorial Decision.
